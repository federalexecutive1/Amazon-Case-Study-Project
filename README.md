# MY FIRST PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

This is where i started my portfolio building after taking a Data Analysis course with the Incubator Hub.

## PROJECT TOPIC : 🛒 AMAZON PRODUCT REVIEW ANALYSIS

This project was completed as part of my project work, to assess how much i have learnt during my course study with the Incubator Hub. I played the role of a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. The goal was to analyze product and customer review data to generate actionable insights that support product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

### 🏢 COMPANY OVERVIEW

RetailTech Insights helps e-commerce sellers unlock growth opportunities through data. Our team provides insights from platforms like Amazon to help brands make informed decisions across product development, marketing, and customer experience.

### 📁 DATASET DESCRIPTION

The dataset consists of data scraped from Amazon product pages, including:

- Product details: Product name, category, actual price, discounted price, discount percentage, and ratings  
- Customer engagement: Rating count, review type, review content, and reviewer details  
- Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated review data in comma-separated format  

#### 🎯 ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES

Using Excel pivot tables and calculated columns, the following questions were answered:

1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?  
2. How many products are listed under each category?  
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?  
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?  
5. What is the average actual price vs discounted price by category?  
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?  
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?  
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?  
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?  
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)?  
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?  
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?  
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?  
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined

#### 🧠 KEY INSIGHTS

- Some categories offer large discounts but receive lower average ratings.
- Only a few products generate most of the total review count and potential revenue.
- A significant number of products have discounts above 50%.
- Products with higher ratings do not always have the highest review counts.
- The relationship between discounts and ratings suggests deeper analysis for pricing strategy.
